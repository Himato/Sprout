## To Production

I think if this was a real world project, I would be thinking about the following: -
1. Clean Architecture
2. Logging System (preferrably connecting with Azure Application Insights)
3. More Unit Tests
4. Authentication & Authorization
5. Connecting to a stable database (Sql Server preferrably)
6. Maybe, CI/CD (preferrably with GitHub Actions)
